## Internalization (I18N)

Habitipy uses Python's builtin `gettext` module to translate messages. If you want to create a new translation for your language, please follow the following instruction.
Messages for translation are scraped from code using `xgettext` utility. It generates a template file with extension `pot`, which is then used to generate and update actual translation file with extension `po`. This is done using `msginit` and `msgmerge` cli utilities to generate and update translation files respectively.
Translation files are kept under `habitipy/i18n` folder with two-letter language code they have translation for.

Any language have a two-letter code. If unsure what code corresponds to your language, please read [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). **From here onward any use of word `yourlang` MUST be replaced with your language's two-letter code.** So a file containing translation for your language will be named `habitipy/i18n/yourlang.po`. For example, russian translation file will be named `habitipy/i18n/ru.po`

When application is running it will use a binary translation file `habitipy/i18n/yourlang/LC_MESSAGES/habitipy.mo`. Those files are generated from `habitipy/i18n/yourlang.po` which contain the actual translation. The encoding of `mo` files from `po` files is done using `msgfmt` cli utility.

Except for initial `po` file generation other operations should run automatically by using `make`.

### Create a new translation

Run these commands to get yourself a new translation file:

```
make
msginit -i habitipy/i18n/messages.pot -o habitipy/i18n/yourlang.po
```

Then edit `habitica_planner/i18n/yourlang.po` with translations. After that you can rerun `make` and get a binary `mo` file with your translation.
Please commit both `po` and `mo` files. Then you can install the package to test your localization. If you've done the procedure right, you'll get `habitipy` cli tool with every message (except python standard) translated.d

### Localization update

If there is a change in localization strings, you should run `make` again to get merged `habitica_planner/i18n/new_yourlang.po` then copy that over your `habitica_planner/i18n/yourlang.po`.
